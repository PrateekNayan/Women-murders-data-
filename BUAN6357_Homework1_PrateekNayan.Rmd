Question 1:
Ans: For modeling with ARIMA, our first step would be to plot the data to identify any unusual observation. 
a)After applying "autoplot", it can be observed that there is a trend demonstrated in positive and negative with constant variance. Hence it can be concluded that data is not stationary.
b)on applying ACF and PACF plots, it can be observed that there are significant spikes above the blue lines, i.e outside the 95% confidence interval.
c)to convert the data to stationary, first differencing is done, ACF and PACF is plotted for first difference. The plots indicates that the data is stationary now, with 1 spike outside 95%(can be ignored).
d)Now, we can perform Arima model. We have 2 cases:
case1- Arima model with (2,1,2), after inspection, we see that still there is 1 spike at the 2nd lag. 
case2- Arima model with (0,1,0) gives lower AICc value than case1 model but, when we check the residuals there is still 1 spike outside 95%. 
We can consider Arima(2,1,2) as the better model as it doesn't have any spike outside 95% when checked with residuals.
Also as mentioed in the question it's suggested if there are two equally likely candidate models, then choose the one with a moving average process. 

Question 2 :
Ans: After calculating the AICc value for the model(2,1,2) we can notice that the AICc value with constant is -9.93 and the AICc value without constant is -12.46. Since lower AICc value is preferred for the model, we don't add any constant.

Question 3 :
Ans : Tried 4 ways to fit the model :  
Arima(1,2,1), Arima(0,1,0) without constant, Arima(0,1,0) with constant, auto.arima(0,2,3) 
After doing check.residuals(), it can be noticed that there is no spike above 95% confidence interval for the model Arima(0,1,0) without constant. Hence, indicates that the data is in white noise. Yes, the data is satisfactory.

Question 4 :
Ans : With h=3, the plots and forecast results has been shown in the above code

Question 5 :
Ans : auto.arima() has been implemented with and without restrictions. 
With restriction it gives the model Arima(1,2,1) with AICc value as -6.39 & without restriction it gives Arima(0,2,3) with AICc value -6.7. 
But when we tried with several different values of p&q after interpreting from plots, Arima(2,1,2) performs the best with 0 outliers while checking the residuals. According to me Arima(2,1,2) performs better.
